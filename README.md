# Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-System-for-Business-Analytics-and-Customer-Personalization

Overview
This project implements and optimizes machine learning models for multiple tasks: classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation. It is designed to help businesses analyze customer behavior, predict trends, and personalize customer experiences.

Key Features:
Classification: Predict customer churn (whether a customer is likely to leave the service).
Regression: Predict sales or demand for products.
Clustering: Segment customers based on behavior and preferences.
Recommendation System: Personalized product recommendations based on purchase history.
Dataset
This project uses the Retail Rocket Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains data about customer demographics, product interactions (views, carts, purchases), and timestamps of transactions.

You can access the dataset here: Retail Rocket Dataset on Kaggle

Dataset Features:
Customer demographics (age, gender, location).
Product interactions (viewing, adding to cart, purchasing).
Transaction time and dates.
Customer purchase history.
